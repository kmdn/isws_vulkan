# **"Was Michelangelo actually a Turtle?"** 

## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository contains the research conducted by **Team Vulcan** during the **International Semantic Web Summer School ([ISWS 2025](https://2025.semanticwebschool.org/))**, based on the research problem proposed by **Prof. Harald Sack**.

Our study explores the potential of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Entity Linking (EL)** in **historical, multilingual, and culturally complex texts**, specifically focusing on *Giorgio Vasariâ€™s* 1568 *Le vite deâ€™ piÃ¹ eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori*.

We investigated prompt-based techniques for semantic information extraction without fine-tuning, and examined the integration of **CIDOC-CRM ontology** to scaffold cultural heritage entity recognition and knowledge graph construction.

### Research Questions:

- **RQ1:** How accurately and consistently can LLMs perform NER and EL on multilingual, historical documents?
- **RQ2:** Can reliable ground truths be created without being fluent in a given source language?
- **RQ3:** Can ontologies enhance the evidence-finding process and the reliability of LLM-extracted data?
